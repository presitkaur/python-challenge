## PyBank

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

    1. The total number of months included in the dataset

    2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
